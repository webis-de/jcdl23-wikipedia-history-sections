In [[traditional animation]], images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent [[cel|celluloid sheets]] to be photographed and exhibited on [[film]]. Today, most animations are made with [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI). [[Computer animation]] can be very detailed [[Computer animation#Animation methods|3D animation]], while [[Traditional animation#Computers and traditional animation|2D computer animation]] (which may have the look of traditional animation) can be used for stylistic reasons, low bandwidth, or faster [[real-time rendering]]s. Other common animation methods apply a [[stop motion]] technique to two and three-dimensional objects like [[cutout animation|paper cutouts]], [[puppet]]s, or [[Clay animation|clay figures]].\n\nAn '''animated cartoon''' is an animated film, usually a [[short film]] aimed at children and featuring an [[cartoon|exaggerated visual style]]. The style takes inspiration from [[comic strips]], often featuring [[anthropomorphic animal]]s, [[superhero]]es, or the adventures of child protagonists. Especially with animals that form a natural predator/prey relationship (e.g. cats and mice, coyotes and birds) the action often centers around [[cartoon violence|violent]] [[physical comedy|pratfalls]] such as falls, collisions and explosions that would be lethal in real life.  \n\nCommonly, [[animator|animators]] achieved the effect by a rapid succession of images that minimally differ from each other. The illusion\u2014as in motion pictures in general\u2014is thought to rely on the [[phi phenomenon]] and [[beta movement]], but the exact causes are still uncertain. [[Analog device|Analog]] mechanical animation media that rely on the rapid display of sequential images include the [[phenakistiscope|ph\u00e9nakisticope]], [[zoetrope]], [[flip book]], [[praxinoscope]], and film. [[Television]] and [[video]] are popular electronic animation media that originally were analog and now operate [[digital media|digitally]]. For display on computers, technology such as the [[animated GIF]] and [[Flash animation]] were developed.\n\nIn addition to [[short films]], [[feature films]], [[Television show|television series]], animated GIFs, and other media dedicated to the display of moving images, animation is also prevalent in [[video game]]s, [[motion graphics]], [[user interface]]s, and [[visual effects]].{{sfn|Buchan|2013}}\n\nThe physical movement of image parts through simple mechanics\u2014for instance moving images in [[magic lantern]] shows\u2014can also be considered animation. The mechanical manipulation of three-dimensional puppets and objects to emulate living beings has a very long history in [[automaton|automata]]. Electronic automata were popularized by [[Disney]] as [[animatronics]].{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word &quot;animation&quot; stems from the Latin &quot;anim\u0101ti\u014dn&quot;, stem of &quot;anim\u0101ti\u014d&quot;, meaning &quot;a bestowing of life&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/animation | title=The definition of animation on dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary meaning of the English word is &quot;liveliness&quot; and has been in use much longer than the meaning of &quot;moving image medium&quot;.\n\n==History&lt;!--'Animated cartoon' redirects here--&gt;==\n{{Main|History of animation}}\n===Before cinematography===\n[[File:Prof. Stampfer's Stroboscopische Scheibe No. X.gif|thumb|Nr. 10 in the reworked second series of Stampfer's stroboscopic discs published by Trentsensky &amp; Vieweg in 1833.]]\n\nHundreds of years before the introduction of true animation, people all over the world enjoyed shows with moving figures that were created and manipulated manually in [[puppetry]], [[automaton|automata]], [[shadow play]], and the [[magic lantern]]. The multi-media [[phantasmagoria]] shows that were very popular in East-European theatres from the late 18th century through the first half of the 19th century, featured lifelike projections of moving ghosts and other frightful imagery in motion.\n\n[[File:Lanature1882 praxinoscope projection reynaud.png|thumb|A projecting [[praxinoscope]], from 1882, here shown superimposing an animated figure on a separately projected background scene]]\nIn 1833, the [[stroboscope|stroboscopic]] disc (better known as the [[phenakistiscope|ph\u00e9nakisticope]]) introduced the principle of modern animation with sequential images that were shown one by one in quick succession to form an optical illusion of motion pictures. Series of sequential images had occasionally been made over thousands of years, but the stroboscopic disc provided the first method to represent such images in fluent motion and for the first time had artists creating series with a proper systematic breakdown of movements. The stroboscopic animation principle was also applied in the [[zoetrope]] (1866), the [[flip book]] (1868) and the [[praxinoscope]] (1877). The average 19th-century animation contained about 12 images that were displayed as a continuous loop by spinning a device manually. The flip book often contained more pictures and had a beginning and end, but its animation would not last longer than a few seconds. The first to create much longer sequences seem to have been [[Charles-\u00c9mile Reynaud]], who between 1892 and 1900 had much success with his 10- to 15-minute-long ''[[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Optique|Pantomimes Lumineuses]]''.\n\n===Silent era===\nWhen [[cinematography]] eventually broke through in 1895 after animated pictures had been known for decades, the wonder of the realistic details in the new medium was seen as its biggest accomplishment. Animation on film was not commercialized until a few years later by manufacturers of optical toys, with [[chromolithography]] film loops (often traced from live-action footage) for adapted toy magic lanterns intended for kids to use at home. It would take some more years before animation reached movie theaters.\n \nAfter earlier experiments by movie pioneers [[J. Stuart Blackton]], [[Arthur Melbourne-Cooper]], [[Segundo de Chom\u00f3n]], and [[Edwin S. Porter]] (among others), Blackton's ''The Haunted Hotel'' (1907) was the first huge [[stop motion]] success, baffling audiences by showing objects that apparently moved by themselves in full photographic detail, without signs of any known stage trick.\n\n[[File:Fantasmagorie (Cohl).GIF|thumb|''[[Fantasmagorie (1908 film)|Fantasmagorie]]'' (1908) by [[\u00c9mile Cohl]]]]\n[[\u00c9mile Cohl]]'s ''[[Fantasmagorie (1908 film)|Fantasmagorie]]'' (1908) is the oldest known example of what became known as [[traditional animation|traditional (hand-drawn) animation]]. Other great artistic and very influential short films were created by [[Ladislas Starevich]] with his puppet animations since 1910 and by [[Winsor McCay]] with detailed drawn animation in films such as ''[[Little Nemo (1911 film)|Little Nemo]]'' (1911) and ''[[Gertie the Dinosaur]]'' (1914).\n\nDuring the 1910s, the production of animated &quot;[[cartoons]]&quot; became an industry in the US.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=28}} Successful producer [[John Randolph Bray]] and animator [[Earl Hurd]], patented the [[cel animation]] process that dominated the animation industry for the rest of the century.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=24}}{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=34}} [[Felix the Cat]], who debuted in 1919, became the first animated superstar.\n\n===American golden age===\nIn 1928, ''[[Steamboat Willie]]'', featuring [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Minnie Mouse]], popularized film with synchronized sound and put [[Walt Disney]]'s studio at the forefront of the animation industry.\n\nThe enormous success of Mickey Mouse is seen as the start of the [[golden age of American animation]] that would last until the 1960s. The United States dominated the world market of animation with a plethora of cel-animated theatrical shorts. Several studios would introduce characters that would become very popular and would have long-lasting careers, including [[Maria Butinova|Maria Butinova Studios]]' [[Mapmo]] (1924), [[The Leo King Knott]] (1931), [[Walt Disney Productions]]' [[Goofy]] (1932) and [[Donald Duck]] (1934), [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]]' [[Looney Tunes]] characters like [[Porky Pig]] (1935), [[Daffy Duck]] (1937), [[Bugs Bunny]] (1938/1940), [[Tweety]] (1941/1942), [[Sylvester the Cat]] (1945), [[Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner]] (1949), [[Fleischer Studios]]/[[Paramount Cartoon Studios]]' [[Betty Boop]] (1930), [[Popeye#Theatrical animated cartoons|Popeye]] (1933), [[Superman (1940s cartoons)|Superman]] (1941) and [[Casper the friendly ghost|Casper]] (1945), [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|MGM cartoon studio]]'s [[Tom and Jerry]] (1940) and [[Droopy]], [[Walter Lantz Productions]]/[[Universal Studio Cartoons]]' [[Woody Woodpecker]] (1940), [[Terrytoons]]/[[20th Century Fox]]'s [[Dinky Duck]] (1939), [[Mighty Mouse]] (1942) and [[Heckle and Jeckle]] (1946) and [[United Artists]]' [[Pink Panther (character)|Pink Panther]] (1963).\n\n===Features before CGI===\n[[File:Quirino Cristiani con una figura.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Italian-Argentine cartoonist [[Quirino Cristiani]] showing the cut and articulated figure of his satirical character ''El Peludo'' (based on President [[Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen|Yrigoyen]]) patented in 1916 for the realization of his films, including the world's first animated feature film ''[[El Ap\u00f3stol]]''.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|p=49}}]]\nIn 1917, Italian-Argentine director [[Quirino Cristiani]] made the first feature-length film ''[[El Ap\u00f3stol]]'' (now [[lost film|lost]]), which became a critical and commercial success. It was followed by Cristiani's ''[[Sin dejar rastros]]'' in 1918, but one day after its premiere the film was confiscated by the government.\n\nAfter working on it for three years, [[Lotte Reiniger]] released the German feature-length [[silhouette animation]] ''[[Die Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed]]'' in 1926, the oldest extant animated feature.\n\nIn 1937, [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Studios]] premiered their first animated feature, ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', still one of the highest-grossing traditional animation features {{as of|lc=y| May 2020}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;snowwhite1&quot;&gt;* Total prior to 50th anniversary reissue: {{cite news |last=Culhane |first=John |title='Snow White' At 50: Undimmed Magic |date=July 12, 1987 |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/12/movies/snow-white-at-50-undimmed-magic.html |access-date=June 29, 2014 |quote=By now, it has grossed about $330&amp;nbsp;million worldwide - so it remains one of the most popular films ever made. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140604200704/http://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/12/movies/snow-white-at-50-undimmed-magic.html |archive-date=June 4, 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;snowwhite2&quot;&gt;* 1987 and 1993 grosses from North America: {{cite web |title=Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs \u2013 Releases |work=[[Box Office Mojo]] |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=releases&amp;id=snowwhite.htm |access-date=June 29, 2014 |quote=1987 release \u2013 $46,594,212; 1993 release \u2013 $41,634,471 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529094807/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=releases&amp;id=snowwhite.htm |archive-date=May 29, 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fleischer studios followed this example in 1939 with ''[[Gulliver's Travels (1939 film)|Gulliver's Travels]]'' with some success. Partly due to foreign markets being cut off by the Second World War, Disney's next features ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'', ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (both 1940) and Fleischer Studios' second animated feature ''[[Mr. Bug Goes to Town]]'' (1941/1942) failed at the box office. For decades afterward Disney would be the only American studio to regularly produce animated features, until [[Ralph Bakshi]] became the first to also release more than a handful features. Sullivan-Bluth Studios began to regularly produce animated features starting with ''[[An American Tail]]'' in 1986.\n\nAlthough relatively few titles became as successful as Disney's features, other countries developed their own animation industries that produced both short and feature theatrical animations in a wide variety of styles, relatively often including [[stop motion]] and [[cutout animation]] techniques. Russia's [[Soyuzmultfilm]] animation studio, founded in 1936, produced 20 films (including shorts) per year on average and reached 1,582 titles in 2018. China, Czechoslovakia / Czech Republic, Italy, France, and Belgium were other countries that more than occasionally released feature films, while Japan became a true powerhouse of animation production, with its own recognizable and influential [[anime]] style of effective [[limited animation]].\n\n===Television===\nAnimation became very popular on television since the 1950s, when television sets started to become common in most developed countries. Cartoons were mainly programmed for children, on convenient time slots, and especially US youth spent many hours watching [[Saturday-morning cartoon]]s. Many classic cartoons found a new life on the small screen and by the end of the 1950s, the production of new animated cartoons started to shift from theatrical releases to TV series. [[Hanna-Barbera Productions]] was especially prolific and had huge hit series, such as ''[[The Flintstones]]'' (1960\u20131966) (the first [[prime time]] animated series), ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' (since 1969) and Belgian co-production ''[[The Smurfs (1981 TV series)|The Smurfs]]'' (1981\u20131989). The constraints of American television programming and the demand for an enormous quantity resulted in cheaper and quicker [[limited animation]] methods and much more formulaic scripts. Quality dwindled until more daring animation surfaced in the late 1980s and in the early 1990s with hit series such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'' (since 1989) as part of a &quot;renaissance&quot; of American animation.\n\nWhile US animated series also spawned successes internationally, many other countries produced their own child-oriented programming, relatively often preferring [[stop motion]] and [[puppetry]] over cel animation. Japanese [[anime]] TV series became very successful internationally since the 1960s, and European producers looking for affordable cel animators relatively often started co-productions with Japanese studios, resulting in hit series such as ''[[Barbapapa]]'' (The Netherlands/Japan/France 1973\u20131977), ''[[Vicky the Viking|Wickie und die starken M\u00e4nner/\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u30d0\u30a4\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0 \u30d3\u30c3\u30b1 (Vicky the Viking)]]'' (Austria/Germany/Japan 1974), and ''[[The Jungle Book (1989 TV series)|The Jungle Book]]'' (Italy/Japan 1989).\n\n===Switch from cels to computers===\n{{main|History of computer animation}}\n\n[[Computer animation]] was gradually developed since the 1940s. 3D wireframe animation started popping up in the mainstream in the 1970s, with an early (short) appearance in the sci-fi thriller ''[[Futureworld]]'' (1976).\n\n''[[The Rescuers Down Under]]'' was the first feature film to be completely created digitally without a camera.&lt;ref name=&quot;first digital guinness&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/first-fully-digital-feature-film/ |title=First fully digital feature film |work=Guinness World Records |publisher=Guinness World Records Limited |access-date=2018-12-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was produced in a style that's very similar to traditional cel animation on the [[Computer Animation Production System]] (CAPS), developed by [[The Walt Disney Company]] in collaboration with [[Pixar]] in the late 1980s.\n\nThe so-called 3D style, more often associated with computer animation, has become extremely popular since Pixar's ''[[Toy Story]]'' (1995), the first computer-animated feature in this style.\n\nMost of the cel animation studios switched to producing mostly computer animated films around the 1990s, as it proved cheaper and more profitable. Not only the very popular 3D animation style was generated with computers, but also most of the films and series with a more traditional hand-crafted appearance, in which the charming characteristics of cel animation could be emulated with software, while new digital tools helped developing new styles and effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cartoonbrew.com/interviews/sergio-pablos-talks-about-his-stunning-hand-drawn-project-klaus-exclusive-113621.html |title=Sergio Pablos Talks About His Stunning Hand-Drawn Project 'Klaus' |last=Amidi |first=Amid |date=1 June 2015 |website=[[Cartoon Brew]] |access-date=12 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHxhr6KAaUw | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211122/FHxhr6KAaUw| archive-date=2021-11-22 | url-status=live|title=The Origins of Klaus |date=10 October 2019 |website=[[YouTube]] |access-date=12 October 2019}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bernstein|first=Abbie|title=Assignment X|url=http://www.assignmentx.com/2013/exclusive-interview-john-kahrs-kristina-reed-on-paperman/|work=Exclusive Interview: John Kahrs &amp; Kristina Reed on PAPERMAN|publisher=Midnight Productions, Inc|access-date=6 October 2013|date=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/06/28/first-look-paperman/2/#id=I2_1340992465384&amp;parent=http%3A%2F%2Finsidemovies.ew.com&amp;rpctoken=342270562&amp;_methods=onPlusOne%2Constartinteraction%2C_ready%2C_close%2C_open%2C_resizeMe%2C_renderstart|title=FIRST LOOK: Disney's 'Paperman' fuses hand-drawn charm with digital depth|work=EW.com|access-date=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sarto|first=Dan|title=Inside Disney's New Animated Short Paperman|url=http://www.awn.com/articles/short-films/inside-disney-s-new-animated-short-paperman|publisher=Animation World Network|access-date=5 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3dworldmag.com/2012/06/29/disneys-paperman-animated-short-fuses-cg-and-hand-drawn-techniques/|title=Disney's Paperman animated short fuses CG and hand-drawn techniques|access-date=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Economic status==\nIn 2008, the animation market was worth US$68.4 billion.{{sfn|Board of Investments|2009}} Animated feature-length films returned the highest [[gross margin]]s (around 52%) of all [[film genre]]s between 2004 and 2013.{{sfn|McDuling|2014}} Animation as an art and industry continues to thrive as of the early 2020s.\n\n==Education, propaganda and commercials==\nThe clarity of animation makes it a powerful tool for instruction, while its total malleability also allows exaggeration that can be employed to convey strong emotions and to thwart reality. It has therefore been widely used for other purposes than mere entertainment.\n\nDuring World War II, animation was widely exploited for propaganda. [[World War II and American animation|Many American studios]], including Warner Bros. and Disney, lent their talents and their cartoon characters to convey to the public certain war values. Some countries, including China, Japan and the United Kingdom, produced their first feature-length animation for their war efforts.\n\nAnimation has been very popular in television commercials, both due to its graphic appeal, and the humour it can provide. Some animated characters in commercials have survived for decades, such as [[Snap, Crackle and Pop]] in advertisements for Kellogg's cereals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Snap, Crackle, Pop\u00ae {{!}} Rice Krispies\u00ae|url=https://www.ricekrispies.com/en_US/our-story.html|access-date=2020-06-16|website=www.ricekrispies.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legendary animation director [[Tex Avery]] was the producer of the first [[Raid (insecticide)|Raid]] &quot;[[Kills Bugs Dead]]&quot; commercials in 1966, which were very successful for the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Taylor|first=Heather|date=2019-06-10|title=The Raid Bugs: Characters We Love To Hate|url=https://popicon.life/the-raid-bugs-characters-we-love-to-hate/|access-date=2020-06-16|website=PopIcon.life|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Other media, merchandise and theme parks==\nApart from their success in movie theaters and television series, many cartoon characters would also prove extremely lucrative when licensed for all kinds of merchandise and for other media.\n\nAnimation has traditionally been very closely related to [[comic book]]s. While many comic book characters found their way to the screen (which is often the case in Japan, where many [[manga]] are adapted into [[anime]]), original animated characters also commonly appear in comic books and magazines. Somewhat similarly, characters and plots for [[video game]]s (an interactive animation medium) have been derived from films and vice versa.\n\nSome of the original content produced for the screen can be used and marketed in other media. Stories and images can easily be adapted into children's books and other printed media. Songs and music have appeared on records and as streaming media.\n\nWhile very many animation companies commercially exploit their creations outside moving image media, [[The Walt Disney Company]] is the best known and most extreme example. Since first being licensed for a children's writing tablet in 1929, their [[Mickey Mouse]] mascot has been [[Mickey Mouse#Merchandising|depicted on an enormous amount of products]], as have many other Disney characters. This may have influenced some [[Mickey Mouse#pejorative use of Mickey's name|pejorative use of Mickey's name]], but [[Disney Consumer Products|licensed Disney products]] sell well, and the so-called [[Disneyana]] has many avid collectors, and even a dedicated Disneyana fanclub (since 1984).\n\n[[Disneyland]] opened in 1955 and features many attractions that were based on Disney's cartoon characters. Its enormous success spawned several other [[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products#Disney resorts|Disney theme parks and resorts]]. [[The Walt Disney Company#Financial data|Disney's earnings]] from the theme parks have relatively often been higher than those from their movies.\n\n==Criticism==\nCriticism of animation has been common in media and cinema since its inception. With its popularity, a large amount of criticism has arisen, especially animated feature-length films.{{sfn|Amidi|2011}} Many concerns of cultural representation, psychological effects on children have been brought up around the animation industry, which has remained rather politically unchanged and stagnant since its inception into mainstream culture.{{sfn|Nagel|2008}}\n\n=== Criticism about the Impact of Animated Movies on Girls ===\nAnimated movies have been created for the sake of entertainment, although there is much more to look at. Subliminal messages are hidden in these animations, for all of them portray a piece of reality, whether it is gender, racial and cultural stereotypes, prejudices, discrimination, values, ideologies, among others.

Besides, in the past, the image of an ideal, correct, and rigorous woman was also commonplace. As audiences change over time, Disney has adapted their representation of traditional Disney princesses to modern times. For the first time, Disney has created the story of a princess that breaks completely with the patterns and stereotypes of typical princesses. For instance, [[Brave (2012 film)|Brave (2012)]] is a movie that shows an independent, rebellious, fearless and unique princess who \u201cdoes not need to get happiness from a man or through marriage\u201d.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Barber|first=Mackenzie|date=2015|title=Disney\u2019s Female Gender Roles: The Change of Modern Culture|url=https://scholars.indstate.edu/bitstream/handle/10484/12132/Barber_McKenzie_2015_HT.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|url-status=live|website=Indiana State University}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Awards==\n{{Main|Animation studio#American studios}}\nAs with any other form of media, animation has instituted awards for excellence in the field.

''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]'' and ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' also received Best Picture nominations after the Academy expanded the number of nominees from five to ten.\n* [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]]\n* [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]]\n\nSeveral other countries have instituted an award for the best-animated feature film as part of their national film awards: [[Africa Movie Academy Award for Best Animation]] (since 2008), [[BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 2006), [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 2011), [[Golden Rooster Award for Best Animation]] (since 1981), [[Goya Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 1989), [[Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year]] (since 2007), [[National Film Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 2006). Also since 2007, the [[Asia Pacific Screen Award for Best Animated Feature Film]] has been awarded at the [[Asia Pacific Screen Awards]]. Since 2009, the [[European Film Awards]] have awarded the [[European Film Award for Best Animated Film]].\n\nThe [[Annie Award]] is another award presented for excellence in the field of animation. Unlike the Academy Awards, the Annie Awards are only received for achievements in the field of animation and not for any other field of technical and artistic endeavour. They were re-organized in 1992 to create a new field for Best Animated Feature. The 1990s winners were dominated by Walt Disney; however, newer studios, led by Pixar &amp; DreamWorks, have now begun to consistently vie for this award. The list of awardees is as follows:\n* [[Annie Award for Best Animated Feature]]\n* [[Annie Award for Best Animated Short Subject]]\n* [[Annie Award for Best Animated Television Production]]\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Joy &amp;amp; Heron - Animated CGI Spot by Passion Pictures.webm|thumb|''Joy &amp; Heron'' \u2013 A featured video]]\nThe creation of non-trivial animation works (i.e., longer than a few seconds) has developed as a form of [[filmmaking]], with certain unique aspects.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=117}} Traits common to both live-action and animated [[Feature film|feature-length films]] are labor intensity and high production costs.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=274}}\n\nThe most important difference is that once a film is in the production phase, the [[marginal cost]] of one more shot is higher for animated films than live-action films.{{sfn|White|2006|p=151}} It is relatively easy for a director to ask for one more [[take]] during [[principal photography]] of a live-action film, but every take on an animated film must be manually rendered by animators (although the task of rendering slightly different takes has been made less tedious by modern computer animation).{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=339}} It is pointless for a studio to pay the salaries of dozens of animators to spend weeks creating a visually dazzling five-minute scene if that scene fails to effectively advance the plot of the film.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=55}} Thus, animation studios starting with Disney began the practice in the 1930s of maintaining story departments where [[storyboard artist]]s develop every single scene through [[storyboard]]s, then handing the film over to the animators only after the production team is satisfied that all the scenes make sense as a whole.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=120}} While live-action films are now also storyboarded, they enjoy more latitude to depart from storyboards (i.e., real-time improvisation).{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=100\u201301}}\n\nAnother problem unique to animation is the requirement to maintain a film's consistency from start to finish, even as films have grown longer and teams have grown larger. Animators, like all artists, necessarily have individual styles, but must subordinate their individuality in a consistent way to whatever style is employed on a particular film.{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=94}} Since the early 1980s, teams of about 500 to 600 people, of whom 50 to 70 are animators, typically have created feature-length animated films. It is relatively easy for two or three artists to match their styles; synchronizing those of dozens of artists is more difficult.{{sfn|Beck|2004|p=37}}\n\nThis problem is usually solved by having a separate group of visual development artists develop an overall look and palette for each film before the animation begins. Character designers on the visual development team draw [[model sheet]]s to show how each character should look like with different facial expressions, posed in different positions, and viewed from different angles.{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=34}}{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=146}} On traditionally animated projects, [[maquette]]s were often sculpted to further help the animators see how characters would look from different angles.{{sfn|Williams|2001|pp=52\u201357}}{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=34}}\n\nUnlike live-action films, animated films were traditionally developed beyond the synopsis stage through the storyboard format; the storyboard artists would then receive credit for writing the film.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=99\u2013100}} In the early 1960s, animation studios began hiring professional screenwriters to write screenplays (while also continuing to use story departments) and screenplays had become commonplace for animated films by the late 1980s.\n\n==Techniques==\n===Traditional===\n{{Main|Traditional animation}}\n[[File:Animhorse.gif|thumb|An example of traditional animation, a horse animated by [[rotoscoping]] from [[Eadweard Muybridge]]'s 19th-century photos.]]\n'''Traditional animation''' (also called cel animation or hand-drawn animation) was the process used for most animated films of the 20th century.{{sfn|White|2006|p=31}} The individual frames of a traditionally animated film are photographs of drawings, first drawn on paper.{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=153}} To create the illusion of movement, each drawing differs slightly from the one before it. The animators' drawings are traced or photocopied onto transparent acetate sheets called [[cel]]s,{{sfn|Thomas|Johnston|1981|pp=277\u201379}} which are filled in with paints in assigned colors or tones on the side opposite the line drawings.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=203}} The completed character cels are photographed one-by-one against a painted background by a [[rostrum camera]] onto motion picture film.{{sfn|White|2006|pp=195\u2013201}}\n\nThe traditional cel animation process became obsolete by the beginning of the 21st century. Today, animators' drawings and the backgrounds are either scanned into or drawn directly into a computer system.{{sfn|Buchan|2013}}{{sfn|White|2006|p=394}} Various software programs are used to color the drawings and simulate camera movement and effects.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=296}} The final animated piece is output to one of several delivery media, including traditional [[35 mm movie film|35&amp;nbsp;mm film]] and newer media with [[digital video]].{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=35\u201336, 52\u201353}}{{sfn|Buchan|2013}} The &quot;look&quot; of traditional cel animation is still preserved, and the [[Character animation|character animator]]s' work has remained essentially the same over the past 70 years.{{sfn|Williams|2001|pp=52\u201357}} Some animation producers have used the term &quot;[[tradigital art|tradigital]]&quot; (a play on the words &quot;traditional&quot; and &quot;digital&quot;) to describe cel animation that uses significant computer technology.\n\nExamples of traditionally animated feature films include ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (United States, 1940),{{sfn|Solomon|1989|pp=63\u201365}} ''[[Animal Farm (1954 film)|Animal Farm]]'' (United Kingdom, 1954), ''[[Lucky and Zorba]]'' (Italy, 1998), and ''[[The Illusionist (2010 film)|The Illusionist]]'' (British-French, 2010). Traditionally animated films produced with the aid of computer technology include ''[[The Lion King]]'' (US, 1994), ''[[The Prince of Egypt]]'' (US, 1998), ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'' (Japan, 1988),{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=80}} ''[[Spirited Away]]'' (Japan, 2001), ''[[The Triplets of Belleville]]'' (France, 2003), and ''[[The Secret of Kells]]'' (Irish-French-Belgian, 2009).\n\n====Full====\n'''Full animation''' refers to the process of producing high-quality traditionally animated films that regularly use detailed drawings and plausible movement,{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=71}} having a smooth animation.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|pp=194\u201395}} Fully animated films can be made in a variety of styles, from more realistically animated works like those produced by the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney studio]] (''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', ''The Lion King'') to the more 'cartoon' styles of the [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Warner Bros. animation studio]]. Many of the [[Disney animated features]] are examples of full animation, as are non-Disney works, ''[[The Secret of NIMH]]'' (US, 1982), ''[[The Iron Giant]]'' (US, 1999), and ''[[Nocturna (Film)|Nocturna]]'' (Spain, 2007). Fully animated films are animated at 24 frames per second, with a combination of animation on ones and twos, meaning that drawings can be held for one frame out of 24 or two frames out of 24.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=25\u201326}}\n\n====Limited====\n{{Main|Limited animation}}\n'''[[Limited animation]]''' involves the use of less detailed or more stylized drawings and methods of movement usually a choppy or &quot;skippy&quot; movement animation.{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=142}} Limited animation uses fewer drawings per second, thereby limiting the fluidity of the animation. This is a more economic technique. Pioneered by the artists at the American studio [[United Productions of America]],{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|pp=54\u201355}} limited animation can be used as a method of stylized artistic expression, as in ''[[Gerald McBoing-Boing]]'' (US, 1951), ''[[Yellow Submarine (1968 film)|Yellow Submarine]]'' (UK, 1968), and certain [[anime]] produced in Japan.{{sfn|Ledoux|1997|p=24, 29}} Its primary use, however, has been in producing cost-effective animated content for media for television (the work of Hanna-Barbera,{{sfn|Lawson|Persons|2004|p=82}} [[Filmation]],{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=241}} and other TV animation studios{{sfn|Lawson|Persons|2004|p=xxi}}) and later the [[Internet]] ([[web cartoon]]s).\n\n====Rotoscoping====\n{{Main|Rotoscoping}}\n'''Rotoscoping''' is a technique patented by [[Max Fleischer]] in 1917 where animators trace live-action movement, frame by frame.{{sfn|Crafton|1993|p=158}} The source film can be directly copied from actors' outlines into animated drawings,{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=163\u201364}} as in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' (US, 1978), or used in a stylized and expressive manner, as in ''[[Waking Life]]'' (US, 2001) and ''[[A Scanner Darkly (film)|A Scanner Darkly]]'' (US, 2006). Some other examples are ''[[Fire and Ice (1983 film)|Fire and Ice]]'' (US, 1983), ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]'' (1981), and ''[[The Flowers of Evil (manga)|Aku no Hana]]'' (Japan, 2013).\n\n====Live-action blending====\n{{Main|Films with live action and animation}}\n'''[[List of films with live action and animation|Live-action/animation]]''' is a technique combining hand-drawn characters into live action shots or live-action actors into animated shots.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=162\u201363}} One of the earlier uses was in [[Koko the Clown]] when Koko was drawn over live-action footage.{{sfn|Beck|2004|pp=18\u201319}} Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks created a series of ''[[Alice Comedies]]'' (1923\u20131927), in which a live-action girl enters an animated world. Other examples include ''[[Allegro Non Troppo]]'' (Italy, 1976), ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' (US, 1988), ''[[Volere volare]]'' (Italy 1991), ''[[Space Jam]]'' (US, 1996) and ''[[Osmosis Jones]]'' (US, 2001).\n\n===Stop motion===\n{{Main|Stop motion}}\n[[Stop-motion animation]] is used to describe animation created by physically manipulating real-world objects and photographing them one frame of film at a time to create the illusion of movement.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=299}} There are many different types of stop-motion animation, usually named after the medium used to create the animation.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=159}} Computer software is widely available to create this type of animation; traditional stop-motion animation is usually less expensive but more time-consuming to produce than current computer animation.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=159}}\n; [[Puppet animation]] : Typically involves stop-motion puppet figures interacting in a constructed environment, in contrast to real-world interaction in model animation.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=171}} The puppets generally have an [[armature (sculpture)|armature]] inside of them to keep them still and steady to constrain their motion to particular joints.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=155\u201356}} Examples include ''[[The Tale of the Fox]]'' (France, 1937), ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (US, 1993), ''[[Corpse Bride]]'' (US, 2005), ''[[Coraline (film)|Coraline]]'' (US, 2009), the films of [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Trnka]] and the adult animated sketch-comedy television series ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' (US, 2005\u2013present).\n:; [[Puppetoon]] : Created using techniques developed by [[George Pal]],{{sfn|Beck|2004|p=70}} are puppet-animated films that typically use a different version of a puppet for different frames, rather than simply manipulating one existing puppet.{{sfn|Beck|2004|pp=92\u201393}}\n[[File:Claychick.jpg|thumb|A clay animation scene from a [[Finland|Finnish]] television commercial]]\n; [[Clay animation]] or [[Plasticine]] animation : (Often called ''claymation'', which, however, is a [[Laika (company)|trademarked]] name). It uses figures made of clay or a similar malleable material to create stop-motion animation.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=299}}{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=150\u2013151}} The figures may have an [[armature (sculpture)|armature]] or wire frame inside, similar to the related puppet animation (below), that can be manipulated to pose the figures.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=151\u201354}} Alternatively, the figures may be made entirely of clay, in the films of [[Bruce Bickford (animator)|Bruce Bickford]], where clay creatures morph into a variety of different shapes. Examples of clay-animated works include ''The [[Gumby]] Show'' (US, 1957\u20131967), ''[[Mio Mao]]'' (Italy, 1974\u20132005), ''[[Morph (animation)|Morph]]'' shorts (UK, 1977\u20132000), ''[[Wallace and Gromit]]'' shorts (UK, as of 1989), [[Jan \u0160vankmajer]]'s ''[[Dimensions of Dialogue]]'' ([[Czechoslovakia]], 1982), ''[[The Trap Door]]'' (UK, 1984).

The technique has been used to create animated films with a range of textural effects difficult to achieve with traditional cel animation.{{sfn|Pilling|1997|p=204}}\n* '''[[Sand animation]]''': sand is moved around on a back- or front-[[light]]ed piece of glass to create each frame for an animated film.{{sfn|Brown|2003|p=7}} This creates an interesting effect when animated because of the light [[Contrast (vision)|contrast]].{{sfn|Furniss|1998|pp=30\u201333}}\n* '''[[Flip book]]''': a flip book (sometimes, especially in British English, called a flick book) is a book with a series of pictures that vary gradually from one page to the next, so that when the pages are turned rapidly, the pictures appear to animate by simulating motion or some other change.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=22\u201324}}{{sfn|Solomon|1989|pp=8\u201310}} Flip books are often illustrated books for children,{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=xiv}} they also are geared towards adults and employ a series of photographs rather than drawings. Flip books are not always separate books, they appear as an added feature in ordinary books or magazines, often in the page corners.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=22\u201324}} Software packages and websites are also available that convert digital video files into custom-made flip books.{{sfn|White|2006|p=203}}\n* '''[[Character animation]]'''\n* '''[[Multi-sketch]]ing'''\n* '''[[Special effect]]s animation'''\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|size=tiny|Animation}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Twelve basic principles of animation]]\n* [[War film#Animated|Animated war film]]\n* [[Animation department]]\n* [[Animated series]]\n* [[Architectural animation]]\n* [[Avar (animation variable)|Avar]]\n* [[Independent animation]]\n* [[International Animation Day]]\n* [[International Animated Film Association]]\n* [[International Tourn\u00e9e of Animation]]\n* [[List of film-related topics]]\n* [[Motion graphic design]]\n* [[Society for Animation Studies]]\n* [[Wire-frame model]]\n\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|22em|refs=\n&lt;ref name=&quot;Harryhausen_Dalton18&quot;&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Harryhausen|Dalton|2008|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n&lt;ref name=&quot;Harryhausen_Dalton222\u2013226&quot;&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Harryhausen|Dalton|2008|pages=222\u201326}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n}}\n\n===Sources===\n====Journal articles====\n{{refbegin|35em}}\n* {{cite journal\n |url = http://www.uca.edu/org/ccsmi/ccsmi/classicwork/Myth%20Revisited.htm |title = Journal of Film and Video\n |date=Spring 1993\n |journal=The Myth of Persistence of Vision Revisited\n |volume=45\n |issue=1\n |pages=3\u201313\n |last=Anderson\n |first=Joseph and Barbara\n |url-status=dead\n |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091124182503/http://www.uca.edu/org/ccsmi/ccsmi/classicwork/Myth%20Revisited.htm\n |archive-date=24 November 2009\n}}\n* {{cite journal\n |last=Serenko\n |first=Alexander\n |year=2007\n |title = Computers in Human Behavior\n |url = http://www.aserenko.com/papers/Serenko_Animation_Scale.pdf\n |journal=The Development of an Instrument to Measure the Degree of Animation Predisposition of Agent Users\n |volume=23\n |number=1\n |pages=478\u201395\n}}\n{{refend}}\n\n====Books====\n{{refbegin|35em}}\n* {{cite book\n |last=Baer\n |first=Eva\n |title=Metalwork in Medieval Islamic Art\n |year=1983\n |publisher=[[State University of New York Press]]\n |isbn=978-0-87395-602-4\n |pages=58, 86, 143, 151, 176, 201, 226, 243, 292, 304\n}}\n* {{cite book\n |last=Beck\n |first=Jerry\n |title=Animation Art: From Pencil to Pixel, the History of Cartoon, Anime &amp;
