The article follows [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (chemistry)#Element names]] for conventions on chemical names, so &quot;sulfur&quot;, etc. should be maintained.--&gt;\n{{Infobox aluminium}}\n'''Aluminium''' ('''aluminum''' in [[American English|American]] and [[Canadian English]]) is a [[chemical element]] with the [[Symbol (chemistry)|symbol]]&amp;nbsp;'''Al''' and [[atomic number]]&amp;nbsp;13. Aluminium has a density lower than those of other common [[metal]]s, at approximately one third that of [[steel]]. It has a great affinity towards [[oxygen]], and [[Passivation (chemistry)|forms a protective layer]] of [[Aluminium oxide|oxide]] on the surface when exposed to air. Aluminium visually resembles silver, both in its color and in its great ability to reflect light. It is soft, [[Magnetism|non-magnetic]] and [[ductility|ductile]]. It has one stable isotope, &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;Al; this isotope is very common, making aluminium the twelfth most common element in the Universe. The radioactivity of [[Aluminum-26|&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al]] is used in [[Radiometric dating|radiodating]].\n\nChemically, aluminium is a weak metal in the [[boron group]]; as is common for the group, aluminium forms compounds primarily in the +3 [[oxidation state]]. The aluminium [[cation]] Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; is small and highly charged; as such, it is polarizing, and [[Chemical bond|bonds]] aluminium forms tend towards [[Covalent bond|covalency]]. The strong affinity towards oxygen leads to aluminium's common association with oxygen in nature in the form of oxides; for this reason, aluminium is found on Earth primarily in rocks in the [[Earth's crust|crust]], where it is the third most abundant element after [[oxygen]] and [[silicon]], rather than in the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]], and virtually never as the free metal.\n\nThe discovery of aluminium was announced in 1825 by Danish physicist [[Hans Christian \u00d8rsted]]. The first industrial production of aluminium was initiated by French chemist [[Henri \u00c9tienne Sainte-Claire Deville]] in 1856. Aluminium became much more available to the public with the [[Hall\u2013H\u00e9roult process]] developed independently by French engineer [[Paul H\u00e9roult]] and American engineer [[Charles Martin Hall]] in 1886, and the mass production of aluminium led to its extensive use in industry and everyday life. In World Wars [[World War I|I]] and [[World War II|II]], aluminium was a crucial [[strategic resource]] for [[aviation]]. In 1954, aluminium became the most produced [[non-ferrous metal]], surpassing [[copper]]. In the 21st century, most aluminium was consumed in transportation, engineering, construction, and packaging in the United States, Western Europe, and Japan.\n\nDespite its prevalence in the environment, no living organism is known to use aluminium [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]] [[metabolically]], but aluminium is well tolerated by plants and animals. Because of the abundance of these salts, the potential for a biological role for them is of continuing interest, and studies continue.\n\n== Physical characteristics ==\n=== Isotopes ===\n{{Main|Isotopes of aluminium}}\n\nOf aluminium isotopes, only {{SimpleNuclide|Aluminium}} is stable. This situation is common for elements with an odd atomic number.{{efn|No elements with odd atomic numbers have more than two stable isotopes; even-numbered elements have multiple stable isotopes, with tin (element 50) having the highest number of stable isotopes of all elements, ten. The single exception is [[beryllium]] which is even-numbered but has only one stable isotope.&lt;ref name=&quot;IAEA&quot; /&gt; See [[Even and odd atomic nuclei]] for more details.}} It is the only [[primordial nuclide|primordial]] aluminium isotope, i.e. the only one that has existed on Earth in its current form since the formation of the planet. Nearly all aluminium on Earth is present as this isotope, which makes it a [[mononuclidic element]] and means that its [[standard atomic weight]] is virtually the same as that of the isotope. This makes aluminium very useful in [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR), as its single stable isotope has a high NMR sensitivity.{{sfn|Greenwood|Earnshaw|1997|pp=242\u2013252}} The standard atomic weight of aluminium is low in comparison with many other metals.{{efn|Most other metals have greater standard atomic weights: for instance, that of iron is 55.8; copper 63.5; lead 207.2.{{CIAAW2013}} which has consequences for the element's properties (see [[#Bulk|below]])}}\n\nAll other isotopes of aluminium are [[radioactive decay|radioactive]]. The most stable of these is [[Aluminium-26|&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al]]: while it was present along with stable &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;Al in the interstellar medium from which the Solar System formed, having been produced by [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] as well, its [[half-life]] is only 717,000&amp;nbsp;years and therefore a detectable amount has not survived since the formation of the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web\n|url=https://ciaaw.org/aluminium.htm\n|title=Aluminium\n|publisher=The Commission on Isotopic Abundances and Atomic Weights|access-date=2020-10-20\n|archive-date=23 September 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200923154544/https://www.ciaaw.org/aluminium.htm|url-status=live}}\n&lt;/ref&gt; However, minute traces of &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al are produced from [[argon]] in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] by [[spallation]] caused by [[cosmic ray]] protons.

Aluminium can relatively easily surrender its three outermost electrons in many chemical reactions (see [[#Chemistry|below]]). The [[electronegativity]] of aluminium is 1.61 (Pauling scale).{{sfn|Dean|1999|p=4.29}}\n[[File:Aluminium Atomic lattice.png|alt=M. Tunes &amp; S.

The few electrons are available for [[metallic bonding]] in aluminium metal are a probable cause for it being soft with a low melting point and low [[electrical resistivity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood222&quot;&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 222\u20134&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n=== Bulk ===\n\nAluminium metal has an appearance ranging from silvery white to dull gray, depending on the [[surface roughness]].{{efn|The two sides of aluminium foil differ in their luster: one is shiny and the other is dull.

Aluminium is also good at reflecting [[solar radiation]], although prolonged exposure to sunlight in air adds wear to the surface of the metal; this may be prevented if aluminium is [[anodization|anodized]], which adds a protective layer of oxide on the surface.\n\nThe density of aluminium is 2.70&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, about 1/3 that of steel, much lower than other commonly encountered metals, making aluminium parts easily identifiable through their lightness.{{sfn|Lide|2004|p=4-3}} Aluminium's low density compared to most other metals arises from the fact that its nuclei are much lighter, while difference in the unit cell size does not compensate for this difference.

Hence, the inner electrons of aluminium shield the valence electrons almost completely, unlike those of aluminium's heavier congeners. As such, aluminium is the most electropositive metal in its group, and its hydroxide is in fact more basic than that of gallium.{{sfn|Greenwood|Earnshaw|1997|pp=224\u2013227}}{{efn|In fact, aluminium's electropositive behavior, high affinity for oxygen, and highly negative [[standard electrode potential]] are all better aligned with those of [[scandium]], [[yttrium]], [[lanthanum]], and [[actinium]], which like aluminium have three valence electrons outside a noble gas core; this series shows continuous trends whereas those of group 13 is broken by the first added d-subshell in gallium and the resulting [[d-block contraction]] and the first added f-subshell in thallium and the resulting [[lanthanide contraction]].{{sfn|Greenwood|Earnshaw|1997|pp=224\u2013227}}}} Aluminium also bears minor similarities to the metalloid boron in the same group: AlX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; compounds are valence [[isoelectronic]] to BX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; compounds (they have the same valence electronic structure), and both behave as [[Lewis acid]]s and readily form [[adduct]]s.{{sfn|King|1995|p=241}} Additionally, one of the main motifs of boron chemistry is [[regular icosahedron|regular icosahedral]] structures, and aluminium forms an important part of many icosahedral [[quasicrystal]] alloys, including the Al\u2013Zn\u2013Mg class.{{sfn|King|1995|pp=235\u2013236}}\n\nAluminium has a high [[chemical affinity]] to oxygen, which renders it suitable for use as a [[reducing agent]] in the [[thermite]] reaction.

One effect of this is that aluminium salts with weak acids are hydrolyzed in water to the aquated hydroxide and the corresponding nonmetal hydride: for example, [[aluminium sulfide]] yields [[hydrogen sulfide]]. However, some salts like [[aluminium carbonate]] exist in aqueous solution but are unstable as such; and only incomplete hydrolysis takes place for salts with strong acids, such as the halides, [[aluminium nitrate|nitrate]], and [[aluminium sulfate|sulfate]]. For similar reasons, anhydrous aluminium salts cannot be made by heating their &quot;hydrates&quot;: hydrated aluminium chloride is in fact not AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;\u00b76H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O but [Al(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and the Al\u2013O bonds are so strong that heating is not sufficient to break them and form Al\u2013Cl bonds instead:{{sfn|Greenwood|Earnshaw|1997|pp=224\u2013227}}\n\n:2[Al(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; {{overunderset|\u2192|heat|&amp;nbsp;}} Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 HCl + 9 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O\n\nAll four [[Halide|trihalides]] are well known. Unlike the structures of the three heavier trihalides, [[aluminium fluoride]] (AlF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) features six-coordinate aluminium, which explains its involatility and insolubility as well as high [[heat of formation]].

Aluminium trichloride has major industrial uses involving this reaction, such as in the manufacture of [[anthraquinone]]s and [[styrene]]; it is also often used as the precursor for many other aluminium compounds and as a reagent for converting nonmetal fluorides into the corresponding chlorides (a [[Transhalogenation|transhalogenation reaction]]).{{sfn|Greenwood|Earnshaw|1997|pp=233\u2013237}}\n\nAluminium forms one stable oxide with the [[chemical formula]] Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, commonly called [[alumina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MYAABAAAQBAJ&amp;q=Aluminium+forms+one+stable+oxide,+known+by+its+mineral+name+corundum&amp;pg=PA14|title=Pigment Compendium\n|last1=Eastaugh|first1=Nicholas|last2=Walsh|first2=Valentine|last3=Chaplin|first3=Tracey|last4=Siddall|first4=Ruth|date=2008\n|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-37393-0|language=en|access-date=1 October 2020\n|archive-date=15 April 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210415083327/https://books.google.com/books?id=MYAABAAAQBAJ&amp;q=Aluminium+forms+one+stable+oxide,+known+by+its+mineral+name+corundum&amp;pg=PA14|url-status=live}}\n&lt;/ref&gt; It can be found in nature in the mineral [[corundum]], \u03b1-alumina;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X2NZAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Aluminium+forms+one+stable+oxide,+known+by+its+mineral+name+corundum&amp;pg=PA718\n|title=A treatise on chemistry|last1=Roscoe|first1=Henry Enfield|last2=Schorlemmer|first2=Carl|date=1913\n|publisher=Macmillan|language=en|access-date=1 October 2020\n|archive-date=15 April 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210415111928/https://books.google.com/books?id=X2NZAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Aluminium+forms+one+stable+oxide,+known+by+its+mineral+name+corundum&amp;pg=PA718|url-status=live}}\n&lt;/ref&gt; there is also a \u03b3-alumina phase.{{sfn|Greenwood|Earnshaw|1997|pp=242\u2013252}} Its crystalline form, [[corundum]], is very hard ([[Mohs hardness]] 9), has a high melting point of {{convert|2045|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}, has very low volatility, is chemically inert, and a good electrical insulator, it is often used in abrasives (such as toothpaste), as a refractory material, and in [[ceramics]], as well as being the starting material for the electrolytic production of aluminium metal. [[Sapphire]] and [[ruby]] are impure corundum contaminated with trace amounts of other metals.{{sfn|Greenwood|Earnshaw|1997|pp=242\u2013252}} The two main oxide-hydroxides, AlO(OH), are [[boehmite]] and [[diaspore]].

Many other intermediate and related structures are also known.{{sfn|Greenwood|Earnshaw|1997|pp=242\u2013252}} Most are produced from ores by a variety of wet processes using acid and base. Heating the hydroxides leads to formation of corundum. These materials are of central importance to the production of aluminium and are themselves extremely useful. Some mixed oxide phases are also very useful, such as [[spinel]] (MgAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), Na-\u03b2-alumina (NaAl&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[tricalcium aluminate]] (Ca&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, an important mineral phase in [[Portland cement]]).{{sfn|Greenwood|Earnshaw|1997|pp=242\u2013252}}\n\nThe only stable [[chalcogenide]]s under normal conditions are [[aluminium sulfide]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[aluminium selenide|selenide]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[aluminium telluride|telluride]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). All three are prepared by direct reaction of their elements at about {{convert|1000|\u00b0C|-2|abbr=on}} and quickly hydrolyze completely in water to yield aluminium hydroxide and the respective [[hydrogen chalcogenide]]. As aluminium is a small atom relative to these chalcogens, these have four-coordinate tetrahedral aluminium with various polymorphs having structures related to [[wurtzite]], with two-thirds of the possible metal sites occupied either in an orderly (\u03b1) or random (\u03b2) fashion; the sulfide also has a \u03b3 form related to \u03b3-alumina, and an unusual high-temperature hexagonal form where half the aluminium atoms have tetrahedral four-coordination and the other half have trigonal bipyramidal five-coordination. {{sfn|Greenwood|Earnshaw|1997|pp=252\u2013257}}\n\nFour [[pnictide]]s \u2013 [[aluminium nitride]] (AlN), [[aluminium phosphide]] (AlP), [[aluminium arsenide]] (AlAs), and [[aluminium antimonide]] (AlSb) \u2013 are known.

Bauxite is blended for uniform composition and then is ground. The resulting [[slurry]] is mixed with a hot solution of [[sodium hydroxide]]; the mixture is then treated in a digester vessel at a pressure well above atmospheric, dissolving the aluminium hydroxide in bauxite while converting impurities into relatively insoluble compounds:&lt;ref name=&quot;UllmannOxide&quot; /&gt;\n\n{{block indent|Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + OH&lt;sup&gt;\u2212&lt;/sup&gt; \u2192 Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + [Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;\u2212&lt;/sup&gt;}}\n\nAfter this reaction, the slurry is at a temperature above its atmospheric boiling point. It is cooled by removing steam as pressure is reduced. The bauxite residue is separated from the solution and discarded. The solution, free of solids, is seeded with small crystals of aluminium hydroxide; this causes decomposition of the [Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;\u2212&lt;/sup&gt; ions to aluminium hydroxide. After about half of aluminium has precipitated, the mixture is sent to classifiers. Small crystals of aluminium hydroxide are collected to serve as seeding agents; coarse particles are converted to alumina by heating; the excess solution is removed by evaporation, (if needed) purified, and recycled.&lt;ref name=&quot;UllmannOxide&quot;&gt;{{cite book\n|title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry\n|last1=Hudson|first1=L.

In this energy-intensive process, a solution of alumina in a molten ({{convert|950|and|980|C|F}}) mixture of [[cryolite]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;AlF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) with [[calcium fluoride]] is [[electrolysis|electrolyzed]] to produce metallic aluminium.

The former, also called S\u00f6derberg anodes, are less power-efficient and fumes released during baking are costly to collect, which is why they are being replaced by prebaked anodes even though they save the power, energy, and labor to prebake the cathodes. Carbon for anodes should be preferably pure so that neither aluminium nor the electrolyte is contaminated with ash. Despite carbon's resistivity against corrosion, it is still consumed at a rate of 0.4\u20130.5&amp;nbsp;kg per each kilogram of produced aluminium. Cathodes are made of [[anthracite]]; high purity for them is not required because impurities [[Leaching (chemistry)|leach]] only very slowly. The cathode is consumed at a rate of 0.02\u20130.04&amp;nbsp;kg per each kilogram of produced aluminium.
