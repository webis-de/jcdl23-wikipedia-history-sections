They observe [[astronomical object]]s such as [[star]]s, [[planet]]s, [[natural satellite|moons]], [[comet]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]] \u2013 in either [[observational astronomy|observational]] (by analyzing the data) or [[theoretical astronomy]]. Examples of topics or fields astronomers study include [[planetary science]], [[Sun|solar astronomy]], the origin or [[stellar evolution|evolution of stars]], or the [[galaxy formation and evolution|formation of galaxies]]. Related but distinct subjects are like [[physical cosmology]], which studies the [[Universe]] as a whole.\n\n==Types==\nAstronomers usually fall under either of two main types: [[observational astronomy|observational]] and [[theoretical astronomy|theoretical]]. Observational astronomers make direct [[observation]]s of [[Astronomical object|celestial objects]] and analyze the data. In contrast, theoretical astronomers create and investigate [[Conceptual model|model]]s of things that cannot be observed. Because it takes millions to billions of years for a system of stars or a galaxy to complete a life cycle, astronomers must observe snapshots of different systems at unique points in their evolution to determine how they form, evolve, and die. They use these data to create models or [[simulation]]s to theorize how different celestial objects work.\n\nFurther subcategories under these two main [[branches of science|branches]] of astronomy include [[Planetary science|planetary astronomy]], [[galactic astronomy]], or [[physical cosmology]].\n\n== Academic ==\n{{For|subdisciplines|Outline of astronomy}}\n[[Image:Justus Sustermans - Portrait of Galileo Galilei (Uffizi).jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Galileo]] is often referred to as the Father of [[modern astronomy]], portrait by [[Justus Sustermans]]]]\n&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Sagan planetary orbits2.jpg|right|thumb|[[Carl Sagan]] on the set of ''[[Cosmos]]'']] --&gt;\n[[History of astronomy|Historically]], astronomy was more concerned with the [[classification]] and description of [[phenomena]] in the sky, while [[astrophysics]] attempted to explain these phenomena and the differences between them using [[Scientific law|physical laws]]. Today, that distinction has mostly disappeared and the terms &quot;astronomer&quot; and &quot;astrophysicist&quot; are interchangeable. Professional astronomers are highly educated individuals who typically have a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[physics]] or astronomy and are employed by research institutions or universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.noao.edu/education/astfaq.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions About Becoming an Astronomer |access-date=29 March 2009 |publisher=NOAO | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090403101540/http://www.noao.edu/education/astfaq.html| archive-date= 3 April 2009 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; They spend the majority of their time working on research, although they quite often have other duties such as teaching, building instruments, or aiding in the operation of an observatory.\n\nThe [[American Astronomical Society]], which is the major organization of professional astronomers in [[North America]], has approximately 7,000 members. This number includes scientists from other fields such as physics, [[geology]], and [[engineering]], whose research interests are closely related to astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aas.org/ |title=American Astronomical Society Home |access-date=14 August 2009 |publisher=AAS| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090802044012/http://aas.org/|archive-date= 2 August 2009 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Astronomical Union]] comprises almost 10,145 members from 70 different countries who are involved in astronomical research at the PhD level and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iau.org/about/ |title=About IAU |access-date=14 August 2009 |publisher=IAU}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n[[File:\u5357\u516c\u61f7\u4ec1\u50cf.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of the Flemish astronomer [[Ferdinand Verbiest]] who became  Head of the Mathematical Board and Director of the Observatory of the Chinese emperor in 1669]]\nContrary to the classical image of an old astronomer peering through a [[telescope]] through the dark hours of the night, it is far more common to use a [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) camera to record a long, deep exposure, allowing a more sensitive image to be created because the [[light]] is added over time. Before CCDs, [[photographic plates]] were a common method of observation. Modern astronomers spend relatively little time at telescopes usually just a few weeks per year. Analysis of observed phenomena, along with making predictions as to the causes of what they observe, takes the majority of observational astronomers' time.\n\nAstronomers who serve as faculty spend much of their time teaching undergraduate and graduate classes. Most universities also have outreach programs including public telescope time and sometimes [[planetarium]]s as a public service to encourage interest in the field.\n\nThose who become astronomers usually have a broad background in maths, sciences and computing in high school. Taking courses that teach how to research, write, and present papers are also invaluable. In college/university most astronomers get a PhD in astronomy or physics.\n\n== Amateur astronomers ==\n{{main|Amateur astronomy}}\nWhile there is a relatively low number of professional astronomers, the field is popular among [[amateurs]]. Most cities have amateur astronomy clubs that meet on a regular basis and often host [[star party|star parties]]. The [[Astronomical Society of the Pacific]] is the largest general astronomical society in the world, comprising both professional and amateur astronomers as well as educators from 70 different nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.astrosociety.org/about.html |title=About Us |access-date=29 March 2009 |publisher=[[Astronomical Society of the Pacific]]| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090225074145/http://astrosociety.org/about.html| archive-date= 25 February 2009 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like any [[hobby]], most people who think of themselves as amateur astronomers may devote a few hours a month to [[stargazing]] and reading the latest developments in research. However, amateurs span the range from so-called &quot;armchair astronomers&quot; to the very ambitious, who own science-grade telescopes and instruments with which they are able to make their own discoveries and assist professional astronomers in research.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of astronomers]]\n* [[List of women astronomers]]\n* [[List of Muslim astronomers]]\n* [[List of French astronomers]]\n* [[List of Hungarian astronomers]]\n* [[List of Russian astronomers and astrophysicists]]\n* [[List of Slovenian astronomers]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* {{Cite book |last=Dallal |first=Ahmad |contribution=Science, Medicine and Technology |editor-last=Esposito |editor-first=John |title=The Oxford History of Islam |date=1999 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]], New York |isbn=0-300-15911-0 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/islamsciencechal0000dall }}\n* {{Cite journal|last=Kennedy|first=E.S.|title=A Survey of Islamic Astronomical Tables; Transactions of the American Philosophical Society| date=1956|location=Philadelphia| publisher=[[American Philosophical Society]]|volume=46|issue=2}}\n* {{Cite encyclopedia\n  | last = Toomer\n  | first = Gerald\n  | title = Al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b, Abu Ja\u02bffar Mu\u1e25ammad ibn M\u016bs\u0101\n  | encyclopedia = [[Dictionary of Scientific Biography]]\n  | volume = 7\n  | editor = Gillispie, Charles Coulston\n  | publisher = [[Charles Scribner's Sons]]\n  | location = New York\n  | date = 1990\n  | isbn = 0-684-16962-2\n  }}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.aas.org American Astronomical Society]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20180907185732/http://eas.unige.ch/ European Astronomical Society]\n* [http://www.iau.org International Astronomical Union]\n* [http://www.astrosociety.org Astronomical Society of the Pacific]\n* [http://www.space.com Space's astronomy news]\n\n{{Astronomy navbox}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Astronomy]]\n[[Category:Astronomers| ]]\n[[Category:Science occupations]]\n"}
