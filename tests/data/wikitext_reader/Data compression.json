Lossless compression reduces bits by identifying and eliminating [[Redundancy (information theory)|statistical redundancy]]. No information is lost in lossless compression. Lossy compression reduces bits by removing unnecessary or less important information.&lt;ref name=&quot;PujarKadlaskar&quot;/&gt; Typically, a device that performs data compression is referred to as an encoder, and one that performs the reversal of the process (decompression) as a decoder.\n\nThe process of reducing the size of a [[data file]] is often referred to as data compression. In the context of [[data transmission]], it is called source coding; encoding done at the source of the data before it is stored or transmitted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salomon&quot;/&gt; Source coding should not be confused with [[channel coding]], for error detection and correction or [[line coding]], the means for mapping data onto a signal.\n\nCompression is useful because it reduces the resources required to store and transmit data. [[Computational resource]]s are consumed in the compression and decompression processes. Data compression is subject to a [[Space\u2013time tradeoff|space\u2013time complexity trade-off]]. For instance, [[#Video|a compression scheme for video]] may require expensive [[Electronic hardware|hardware]] for the video to be decompressed fast enough to be viewed as it is being decompressed, and the option to decompress the video in full before watching it may be inconvenient or require additional storage. The design of data compression schemes involves trade-offs among various factors, including the degree of compression, the amount of distortion introduced (when using [[lossy data compression]]), and the computational resources required to compress and decompress the data&lt;ref name=&quot;Tank&quot;/&gt;\n\n== Lossless ==\n{{Main|Lossless compression}}\n\n[[Lossless data compression]] [[algorithm]]s usually exploit [[Redundancy (information theory)|statistical redundancy]] to represent data without losing any [[Self-information|information]], so that the process is reversible. Lossless compression is possible because most real-world data exhibits statistical redundancy. For example, an image may have areas of color that do not change over several pixels; instead of coding &quot;red pixel, red pixel, ...&quot; the data may be encoded as &quot;279 red pixels&quot;. This is a basic example of [[run-length encoding]]; there are many schemes to reduce file size by eliminating redundancy.\n\nThe [[Lempel\u2013Ziv]] (LZ) compression methods are among the most popular algorithms for lossless storage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Optimized LZW&quot;/&gt;  [[DEFLATE]] is a variation on LZ optimized for decompression speed and compression ratio, but compression can be slow. In the mid-1980s, following work by [[Terry Welch]], the [[Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Welch]] (LZW) algorithm rapidly became the method of choice for most general-purpose compression systems. LZW is used in [[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]] images, programs such as PKZIP, and hardware devices such as modems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Stephen|first=Wolfram|url=https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p1069--data-compression/|title=New Kind of Science|year=2002|isbn=1-57955-008-8|location=Champaign, IL|pages=1069}}&lt;/ref&gt; LZ methods use a table-based compression model where table entries are substituted for repeated strings of data. For most LZ methods, this table is generated dynamically from earlier data in the input. The table itself is often [[Huffman coding|Huffman encoded]]. [[Grammar-based codes]] like this can compress highly repetitive input extremely effectively, for instance, a biological data collection of the same or closely related species, a huge versioned document collection, internet archival, etc. The basic task of grammar-based codes is constructing a context-free grammar deriving a single string. Other practical grammar compression algorithms include [[Sequitur algorithm|Sequitur]] and Re-Pair.\n\nThe strongest modern lossless compressors use [[Randomized algorithm|probabilistic]] models, such as [[prediction by partial matching]]. The [[Burrows\u2013Wheeler transform]] can also be viewed as an indirect form of statistical modelling.&lt;ref name=&quot;mahmud2&quot;/&gt; In a further refinement of the direct use of [[probabilistic model]]ling, statistical estimates can be coupled to an algorithm called [[arithmetic coding]]. Arithmetic coding is a more modern coding technique that uses the mathematical calculations of a [[finite-state machine]] to produce a string of encoded bits from a series of input data symbols. It can achieve superior compression compared to other techniques such as the better-known Huffman algorithm. It uses an internal memory state to avoid the need to perform a one-to-one mapping of individual input symbols to distinct representations that use an integer number of bits, and it clears out the internal memory only after encoding the entire string of data symbols. Arithmetic coding applies especially well to adaptive data compression tasks where the statistics vary and are context-dependent, as it can be easily coupled with an adaptive model of the [[probability distribution]] of the input data. An early example of the use of arithmetic coding was in an optional (but not widely used) feature of the [[JPEG]] image coding standard.&lt;ref name=TomLane/&gt; It has since been applied in various other designs including [[H.263]], [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC]] and [[HEVC]] for video coding.&lt;ref name=&quot;HEVC&quot;/&gt;\n\nArchive software typically has the ability to adjust the &quot;dictionary size&quot;, where a larger size demands more [[random access memory]] during compression and decompression, but compresses stronger, especially on repeating patterns in files' content.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.winrar-france.fr/winrar_instructions_for_use/source/html/HELPArcOptimal.htm How to choose optimal archiving settings \u2013 WinRAR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://sevenzip.osdn.jp/chm/cmdline/switches/method.htm (Set compression Method) switch \u2013 7zip]&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n== Lossy ==\n{{Main|Lossy compression}}\n\nIn the late 1980s, digital images became more common, and standards for lossless [[image compression]] emerged. In the early 1990s, lossy compression methods began to be widely used.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolfram&quot;/&gt; In these schemes, some loss of information is accepted as dropping nonessential detail can save storage space. There is a corresponding [[trade-off]] between preserving information and reducing size. Lossy data compression schemes are designed by research on how people perceive the data in question. For example, the human eye is more sensitive to subtle variations in [[luminance]] than it is to the variations in color. [[JPEG]] image compression works in part by rounding off nonessential bits of information.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arcangel&quot;/&gt;  A number of popular compression formats exploit these perceptual differences, including [[psychoacoustics]] for sound, and [[psychovisual]]s for images and video.\n\nMost forms of lossy compression are based on [[transform coding]], especially the [[discrete cosine transform]] (DCT). It was first proposed in 1972 by [[N. Ahmed|Nasir Ahmed]], who then developed a working algorithm with T. Natarajan and [[K. R. Rao]] in 1973, before introducing it in January 1974.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahmed&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ahmed |first=Nasir |author-link=N. Ahmed |title=How I Came Up With the Discrete Cosine Transform |journal=[[Digital Signal Processing (journal)|Digital Signal Processing]] |date=January 1991 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=4\u20135 |doi=10.1016/1051-2004(91)90086-Z |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/52879771/DCT-History-How-I-Came-Up-with-the-Discrete-Cosine-Transform}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DCT&quot;/&gt; DCT is the most widely used lossy compression method, and is used in multimedia formats for [[Image compression|images]] (such as [[JPEG]] and [[HEIF]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;JPEG&quot;/&gt; [[Video compression|video]] (such as [[MPEG]], [[H.264/AVC|AVC]] and [[HEVC]]) and audio (such as [[MP3]], [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] and [[Vorbis]]).\n\nLossy [[image compression]] is used in [[digital camera]]s, to increase storage capacities. Similarly, [[DVD]]s, [[Blu-ray]] and [[streaming video]] use lossy [[video coding format]]s. Lossy compression is extensively used in video.\n\nIn lossy audio compression, methods of psychoacoustics are used to remove non-audible (or less audible) components of the [[audio signal]]. Compression of human speech is often performed with even more specialized techniques; [[speech coding]] is distinguished as a separate discipline from general-purpose audio compression. Speech coding is used in [[internet telephony]], for example, audio compression is used for CD ripping and is decoded by the audio players.&lt;ref name=&quot;mahmud2&quot;/&gt;\n\nLossy compression can cause [[generation loss]].\n\n== Theory ==\nThe theoretical basis for compression is provided by [[information theory]] and, more specifically, [[algorithmic information theory]] for lossless compression and [[rate\u2013distortion theory]] for lossy compression. These areas of study were essentially created by [[Claude Shannon]], who published fundamental papers on the topic in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Other topics associated with compression include [[coding theory]] and [[statistical inference]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Marak&quot;/&gt;\n\n=== Machine learning ===\nThere is a close connection between [[machine learning]] and compression. A system that predicts the [[posterior probabilities]] of a sequence given its entire history can be used for optimal data compression (by using [[arithmetic coding]] on the output distribution). An optimal compressor can be used for prediction (by finding the symbol that compresses best, given the previous history). This equivalence has been used as a justification for using data compression as a benchmark for &quot;general intelligence&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mahoney&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Market Efficiency&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ben-Gal&quot;/&gt;\n\nAn alternative view can show compression algorithms implicitly map strings into implicit [[feature space vector]]s, and compression-based similarity measures compute similarity within these feature spaces. For each compressor C(.) we define an associated vector space \u2135, such that C(.) maps an input string x, corresponding to the vector norm ||~x||. An exhaustive examination of the feature spaces underlying all compression algorithms is precluded by space; instead, feature vectors chooses to examine three representative lossless compression methods, LZW, LZ77, and PPM.&lt;ref name=&quot;ScullyBrodley&quot;/&gt;\n\nAccording to [[AIXI]] theory, a connection more directly explained in [[Hutter Prize]], the best possible compression of x is the smallest possible software that generates x. For example, in that model, a zip file's compressed size includes both the zip file and the unzipping software, since you can't unzip it without both, but there may be an even smaller combined form.\n\n=== Data differencing ===\n{{main|Data differencing}}\nData compression can be viewed as a special case of [[data differencing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RFC 3284&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Vdelta&quot;/&gt; Data differencing consists of producing a ''difference'' given a ''source'' and a ''target,'' with patching reproducing the ''target'' given a ''source'' and a ''difference.'' Since there is no separate source and target in data compression, one can consider data compression as data differencing with empty source data, the compressed file corresponding to a difference from nothing. This is the same as considering absolute [[entropy (information theory)|entropy]] (corresponding to data compression) as a special case of [[relative entropy]] (corresponding to data differencing) with no initial data.\n\nThe term ''differential compression'' is used to emphasize the data differencing connection.\n\n== Uses ==\n=== Image ===\n{{Main|Image compression}}\n\n[[Entropy coding]] originated in the 1940s with the introduction of [[Shannon\u2013Fano coding]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Shannon&quot;/&gt; the basis for [[Huffman coding]] which was developed in 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;Huffman&quot;/&gt; [[Transform coding]] dates back to the late 1960s, with the introduction of [[fast Fourier transform]] (FFT) coding in 1968 and the [[Hadamard transform]] in 1969.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hadamard&quot;/&gt;\n\nAn important [[image compression]] technique is the [[discrete cosine transform]] (DCT), a technique developed in the early 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahmed&quot;/&gt; DCT is the basis for [[JPEG]], a [[lossy compression]] format which was introduced by the [[Joint Photographic Experts Group]] (JPEG) in 1992.&lt;ref name=&quot;t81&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=T.81 \u2013 DIGITAL COMPRESSION AND CODING OF CONTINUOUS-TONE STILL IMAGES \u2013 REQUIREMENTS AND GUIDELINES |url=https://www.w3.org/Graphics/JPEG/itu-t81.pdf |publisher=[[CCITT]] |date=September 1992 |access-date=12 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; JPEG greatly reduces the amount of data required to represent an image at the cost of a relatively small reduction in image quality and has become the most widely used [[image file format]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The JPEG image format explained |url=https://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/photography/what-is-a-jpeg-11364206889349 |website=[[BT.com]] |publisher=[[BT Group]] |access-date=5 August 2019 |date=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Baraniuk |first1=Chris |title=Copy protections could come to JPEGs |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-34538705 |access-date=13 September 2019 |work=[[BBC News]] |agency=[[BBC]] |date=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its highly efficient DCT-based compression algorithm was largely responsible for the wide proliferation of [[digital image]]s and [[digital photo]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atlantic&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=What Is a JPEG?

[[List of codecs#Audio|Audio compression algorithms]] are implemented in [[software]] as audio [[codec]]s. In both lossy and lossless compression, [[Redundancy (information theory)|information redundancy]] is reduced, using methods such as [[Coding theory|coding]], [[Quantization (signal processing)|quantization]], [[discrete cosine transform]] and [[linear prediction]] to reduce the amount of information used to represent the uncompressed data.\n\nLossy audio compression algorithms provide higher compression and are used in numerous audio applications including [[Vorbis]] and [[MP3]]. These algorithms almost all rely on [[psychoacoustics]] to eliminate or reduce fidelity of less audible sounds, thereby reducing the space required to store or transmit them.&lt;ref name=&quot;mahdi53&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cunningham |first1=Stuart |last2=McGregor |first2=Iain |title=Subjective Evaluation of Music Compressed with the ACER Codec Compared to AAC, MP3, and Uncompressed PCM |journal=International Journal of Digital Multimedia Broadcasting |volume=2019 |pages=1\u201316 |date=2019 |language=en|doi=10.1155/2019/8265301 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe acceptable trade-off between loss of audio quality and transmission or storage size depends upon the application. For example, one 640 MB [[compact disc]] (CD) holds approximately one hour of uncompressed [[high fidelity]] music, less than 2 hours of music compressed losslessly, or 7 hours of music compressed in the [[MP3]] format at a medium [[bit rate]]. A digital sound recorder can typically store around 200 hours of clearly intelligible speech in 640 MB.&lt;ref name=&quot;Olympus WS-120&quot;/&gt;\n\nLossless audio compression produces a representation of digital data that can be decoded to an exact digital duplicate of the original. Compression ratios are around 50\u201360% of the original size,&lt;ref name=&quot;FLAC comparison&quot;/&gt; which is similar to those for generic lossless data compression. Lossless codecs use [[curve fitting]] or linear prediction as a basis for estimating the signal. Parameters describing the estimation and the difference between the estimation and the actual signal are coded separately.&lt;ref name=&quot;FLAC overview&quot;/&gt;\n\nA number of lossless audio compression formats exist. See [[List of codecs#Lossless compression|list of lossless codecs]] for a listing. Some formats are associated with a distinct system, such as [[Direct Stream Transfer]], used in [[Super Audio CD]] and [[Meridian Lossless Packing]], used in [[DVD-Audio]], [[Dolby TrueHD]], [[Blu-ray]] and [[HD DVD]].\n\nSome [[audio file format]]s feature a combination of a lossy format and a lossless correction; this allows stripping the correction to easily obtain a lossy file. Such formats include [[MPEG-4 SLS]] (Scalable to Lossless), [[WavPack]], and [[OptimFROG DualStream]].\n\nWhen audio files are to be processed, either by further compression or for [[Audio editing|editing]], it is desirable to work from an unchanged original (uncompressed or losslessly compressed). Processing of a lossily compressed file for some purpose usually produces a final result inferior to the creation of the same compressed file from an uncompressed original. In addition to sound editing or mixing, lossless audio compression is often used for archival storage, or as master copies.\n\n==== Lossy audio compression ====\n[[File:AudiodatenkompressionManowarThePowerOfThySword.jpg|thumb|Comparison of [[spectrogram]]s of audio in an uncompressed format and several lossy formats. The lossy spectrograms show [[bandlimiting]] of higher frequencies, a common technique associated with lossy audio compression.]]\n\nLossy audio compression is used in a wide range of applications. In addition to standalone audio-only applications of file playback in MP3 players or computers, digitally compressed audio streams are used in most video DVDs, digital television, streaming media on the [[Internet]], satellite and cable radio, and increasingly in terrestrial radio broadcasts. Lossy compression typically achieves far greater compression than lossless compression, by discarding less-critical data based on [[psychoacoustic]] optimizations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaiswal&quot;/&gt;\n\nPsychoacoustics recognizes that not all data in an audio stream can be perceived by the human [[auditory system]]. Most lossy compression reduces redundancy by first identifying perceptually irrelevant sounds, that is, sounds that are very hard to hear. Typical examples include high frequencies or sounds that occur at the same time as louder sounds. Those irrelevant sounds are coded with decreased accuracy or not at all.\n\nDue to the nature of lossy algorithms, [[audio quality]] suffers a [[digital generation loss]] when a file is decompressed and recompressed. This makes lossy compression unsuitable for storing the intermediate results in professional audio engineering applications, such as sound editing and multitrack recording. However, lossy formats such as [[MP3]] are very popular with end-users as the file size is reduced to 5-20% of the original size and a megabyte can store about a minute's worth of music at adequate quality.\n\n===== Coding methods =====\nTo determine what information in an audio signal is perceptually irrelevant, most lossy compression algorithms use transforms such as the [[modified discrete cosine transform]] (MDCT) to convert [[time domain]] sampled waveforms into a transform domain, typically the [[frequency domain]]. Once transformed, component frequencies can be prioritized according to how audible they are. Audibility of spectral components is assessed using the [[absolute threshold of hearing]] and the principles of [[simultaneous masking]]\u2014the phenomenon wherein a signal is masked by another signal separated by frequency\u2014and, in some cases, [[temporal masking]]\u2014where a signal is masked by another signal separated by time. [[Equal-loudness contour]]s may also be used to weigh the perceptual importance of components. Models of the human ear-brain combination incorporating such effects are often called [[psychoacoustic model]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;faxin47&quot;/&gt;\n\nOther types of lossy compressors, such as the [[linear predictive coding]] (LPC) used with speech, are source-based coders. LPC uses a model of the human vocal tract to analyze speech sounds and infer the parameters used by the model to produce them moment to moment. These changing parameters are transmitted or stored and used to drive another model in the decoder which reproduces the sound.\n\nLossy formats are often used for the distribution of streaming audio or interactive communication (such as in cell phone networks). In such applications, the data must be decompressed as the data flows, rather than after the entire data stream has been transmitted. Not all audio codecs can be used for streaming applications.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaiswal&quot;/&gt;\n\n[[Latency (engineering)|Latency]] is introduced by the methods used to encode and decode the data. Some codecs will analyze a longer segment, called a ''frame'', of the data to optimize efficiency, and then code it in a manner that requires a larger segment of data at one time to decode. The inherent latency of the coding algorithm can be critical; for example, when there is a two-way transmission of data, such as with a telephone conversation, significant delays may seriously degrade the perceived quality.\n\nIn contrast to the speed of compression, which is proportional to the number of operations required by the algorithm, here latency refers to the number of samples that must be analyzed before a block of audio is processed. In the minimum case, latency is zero samples (e.g., if the coder/decoder simply reduces the number of bits used to quantize the signal). Time domain algorithms such as LPC also often have low latencies, hence their popularity in speech coding for telephony. In algorithms such as MP3, however, a large number of samples have to be analyzed to implement a psychoacoustic model in the frequency domain, and latency is on the order of 23&amp;nbsp;ms.\n\n===== Speech encoding =====\n[[Speech encoding]] is an important category of audio data compression. The perceptual models used to estimate what aspects of speech a human ear can hear are generally somewhat different from those used for music. The range of frequencies needed to convey the sounds of a human voice is normally far narrower than that needed for music, and the sound is normally less complex. As a result, speech can be encoded at high quality using a relatively low bit rate.\n\nThis is accomplished, in general, by some combination of two approaches:\n* Only encoding sounds that could be made by a single human voice.\n* Throwing away more of the data in the signal\u2014keeping just enough to reconstruct an &quot;intelligible&quot; voice rather than the full frequency range of human [[hearing (sense)|hearing]].\n\nThe earliest algorithms used in speech encoding (and audio data compression in general) were the [[A-law algorithm]] and the [[\u03bc-law algorithm]].\n\n==== History ====\n[[File:Placa-audioPC-925.jpg|right|thumb|Solidyne 922: The world's first commercial audio bit compression [[sound card]] for PC, 1990]]\n\nEarly audio research was conducted at [[Bell Labs]].

Twenty years later, almost all the radio stations in the world were using similar technology manufactured by a number of companies.\n\nA literature compendium for a large variety of audio coding systems was published in the IEEE's ''Journal on Selected Areas in Communications'' (''JSAC''), in February 1988. While there were some papers from before that time, this collection documented an entire variety of finished, working audio coders, nearly all of them using perceptual techniques and some kind of frequency analysis and back-end noiseless coding.&lt;ref name=&quot;Possibilities&quot;/&gt;\n\n=== Video ===\n{{see also|Video coding format|Video codec}}\n[[Uncompressed video]] requires a very high [[Uncompressed video#Storage and Data Rates for Uncompressed Video|data rate]]. Although [[List of codecs#Lossless video compression|lossless video compression]] codecs perform at a compression factor of 5 to 12, a typical [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|H.264]] lossy compression video has a compression factor between 20 and 200.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSU2007&quot;/&gt;\n\nThe two key video compression techniques used in [[video coding standards]] are the [[discrete cosine transform]] (DCT) and [[motion compensation]] (MC). Most video coding standards, such as the [[H.26x]] and [[MPEG]] formats, typically use motion-compensated DCT video coding (block motion compensation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chen |first1=Jie |last2=Koc |first2=Ut-Va |last3=Liu |first3=KJ Ray |title=Design of Digital Video Coding Systems: A Complete Compressed Domain Approach |date=2001 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |isbn=9780203904183 |page=71 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LUzFKU3HeegC&amp;pg=PA71}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Li&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Li |first1=Jian Ping |title=Proceedings of the International Computer Conference 2006 on Wavelet Active Media Technology and Information Processing: Chongqing, China, 29-31 August 2006 |date=2006 |publisher=[[World Scientific]] |isbn=9789812709998 |page=847 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FZiK3zXdK7sC&amp;pg=PA847}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nMost video codecs are used alongside audio compression techniques to store the separate but complementary data streams as one combined package using so-called ''[[digital container format|container format]]s''.&lt;ref name=&quot;CSIP&quot;/&gt;\n\n==== Encoding theory ====\nVideo data may be represented as a series of still image frames. Such data usually contains abundant amounts of spatial and temporal [[redundancy (information theory)|redundancy]]. Video compression algorithms attempt to reduce redundancy and store information more compactly.\n\nMost [[video compression formats]] and [[video codec|codecs]] exploit both spatial and temporal redundancy (e.g. through difference coding with [[motion compensation]]). Similarities can be encoded by only storing differences between e.g. temporally adjacent frames (inter-frame coding) or spatially adjacent pixels (intra-frame coding). [[inter frame|Inter-frame]] compression (a temporal [[delta encoding]]) (re)uses data from one or more earlier or later frames in a sequence to describe the current frame. [[Intra-frame coding]], on the other hand, uses only data from within the current frame, effectively being still-[[image compression]].&lt;ref name=&quot;faxin47&quot;/&gt;\n\nThe [[Video coding format#Intra-frame video coding formats|intra-frame video coding formats]] used in camcorders and video editing employ simpler compression that uses only intra-frame prediction. This simplifies video editing software, as it prevents a situation in which a compressed frame refers to data that the editor has deleted.&lt;!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]--&gt;\n\nUsually, video compression additionally employs [[lossy compression]] techniques like [[quantization (image processing)|quantization]] that reduce aspects of the source data that are (more or less) irrelevant to the human visual perception by exploiting perceptual features of human vision. For example, small differences in color are more difficult to perceive than are changes in brightness. Compression algorithms can average a color across these similar areas to reduce space, in a manner similar to those used in [[JPEG]] image compression.&lt;ref name=&quot;TomLane&quot;/&gt; As in all lossy compression, there is a [[trade-off]] between [[video quality]] and [[bit rate]], cost of processing the compression and decompression, and system requirements. Highly compressed video may present visible or distracting [[compression artifact|artifacts]].\n\nOther methods than the prevalent DCT-based transform formats, such as [[fractal compression]], [[matching pursuit]] and the use of a [[discrete wavelet transform]] (DWT), have been the subject of some research, but are typically not used in practical products (except for the use of [[wavelet compression|wavelet coding]] as still-image coders without motion compensation). Interest in fractal compression seems to be waning, due to recent theoretical analysis showing a comparative lack of effectiveness of such methods.&lt;ref name=&quot;faxin47&quot;/&gt;\n\n===== Inter-frame coding =====\n{{main|Inter frame}}\n{{see|Motion compensation}}\n\nInter-frame coding works by comparing each frame in the video with the previous one. Individual frames of a video sequence are compared from one frame to the next, and the [[video codec|video compression codec]] sends only the [[residual frame|differences]] to the reference frame. If the frame contains areas where nothing has moved, the system can simply issue a short command that copies that part of the previous frame into the next one. If sections of the frame move in a simple manner, the compressor can emit a (slightly longer) command that tells the decompressor to shift, rotate, lighten, or darken the copy. This longer command still remains much shorter than intraframe compression. Usually, the encoder will also transmit a residue signal which describes the remaining more subtle differences to the reference imagery. Using entropy coding, these residue signals have a more compact representation than the full signal. In areas of video with more motion, the compression must encode more data to keep up with the larger number of pixels that are changing. Commonly during explosions, flames, flocks of animals, and in some panning shots, the high-frequency detail leads to quality decreases or to increases in the [[variable bitrate]].\n\n==== Hybrid block-based transform formats ====\n{{See|Discrete cosine transform}}\n[[File:Hybrid video encoder processing stages.svg|thumb|upright=2|Processing stages of a typical video encoder]]\nToday, nearly all commonly used video compression methods (e.g., those in standards approved by the [[ITU-T]] or [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]) share the same basic architecture that dates back to [[H.261]] which was standardized in 1988 by the ITU-T. They mostly rely on the DCT, applied to rectangular blocks of neighboring pixels, and temporal prediction using [[motion vector]]s, as well as nowadays also an in-loop filtering step.\n\nIn the prediction stage, various [[data deduplication|deduplication]] and difference-coding techniques are applied that help decorrelate data and describe new data based on already transmitted data.\n\nThen rectangular blocks of (residue) [[pixel]] data are transformed to the frequency domain to ease targeting irrelevant information in quantization and for some spatial redundancy reduction. The [[discrete cosine transform]] (DCT) that is widely used in this regard was introduced by [[N. Ahmed]], T. Natarajan and [[K. R. Rao]] in 1974.&lt;ref name=&quot;DCT&quot;/&gt;\n\nIn the main lossy processing stage, that data gets quantized in order to reduce information that is irrelevant to human visual perception.\n\nIn the last stage statistical redundancy gets largely eliminated by an [[entropy encoding|entropy coder]] which often applies some form of arithmetic coding.\n\nIn an additional in-loop filtering stage various filters can be applied to the reconstructed image signal. By computing these filters also inside the encoding loop they can help compression because they can be applied to reference material before it gets used in the prediction process and they can be guided using the original signal. The most popular example are [[deblocking filter]]s that blur out blocking artifacts from quantization discontinuities at transform block boundaries.\n\n==== History ====\n{{Main|Video coding format#History}}\n\nIn 1967, A.H. Robinson and C. Cherry proposed a [[run-length encoding]] bandwidth compression scheme for the transmission of analog television signals.&lt;ref name=&quot;robinson&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author1-last=Robinson |author1-first=A.

In 2012, a team of scientists from Johns Hopkins University published a genetic compression algorithm that does not use a reference genome for compression. HAPZIPPER was tailored for [[International HapMap Project|HapMap]] data and achieves over 20-fold compression (95% reduction in file size), providing 2- to 4-fold better compression and is less computationally intensive than the leading general-purpose compression utilities. For this, Chanda, Elhaik, and Bader introduced MAF-based encoding (MAFE), which reduces the heterogeneity of the dataset by sorting SNPs by their minor allele frequency, thus homogenizing the dataset.&lt;ref name=&quot;HapZipper&quot;/&gt; Other algorithms in 2009 and 2013 (DNAZip and GenomeZip) have compression ratios of up to 1200-fold\u2014allowing 6 billion basepair diploid human genomes to be stored in 2.5 megabytes (relative to a reference genome or averaged over many genomes).&lt;ref name=&quot;genome email&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;genome contracts&quot;/&gt;
