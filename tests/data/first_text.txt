Lance, Mike and Vin, three nice boys from Long Island, NY, started playing music together in 1989 with various other people in various settings and styles. Then they started playing music with Kevin, formerly of Beyond, in the early spring of 1991, this setting was called [http://www.facebook.com/pages/16-Band/107590215941380 1.6 Band]. They played their first show in someone’s back yard in July, 1991.

In the fall of 1991 they recorded their first 7” record, ‘Tongue Family Style,’ with Wharton Tiers. For the rest of 1991 and the first eight months of 1992, 1.6 Band played up and down the East Coast of the US. Before Vin moved to the Maryland suburbs of DC in September to finish college, the group recorded their only LP, again with Tiers. Around this time, Mike started playing in Die 116 for a short while.

The summer of 1993 brought more short road trips and another 7” recorded with Tiers, ‘Pimpin Aint Easy’. 1.6 Band played their last show of that era in DC at the Beta-Punks Warehouse in October, 1993.

Now 15 years later and the band are back at it. Playing live again with the likes of Rorschach, they recorded 4 songs with Chris Pierce at Technical Ecstasy, which brought us the Checkered Past of All Things Present 7&quot; out on [http://www.metastasisrecords.com Metastasis Records].
